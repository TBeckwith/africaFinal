    	<h3>So what is Malaria?</h3>
      <p>Malaria is a disease caused by the <i>Plasmodium</i> type parasite.  This parasite is transmitted through female Mosquitoes.  Specifically the 
      <i>Anopheles</i> Mosquito.  The parasite enters the blood stream through the Mosquitoes saliva (after a bite), and travels to the liver, where is begins
      to reproduce.  Shortly after, it begins taking over Red Blood Cells.  This is what causes what is now known as: Malaria.</p>

    	<h3>Malaria In Africa</h3>
    	<p>The spread of Malaria via mosquitos has been a problem in Africa for a very long 
      time.  According to the <a href ="https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-health/malaria/">United Nations Children's Fund</a> there were 216,000,000 cases
       of Malaria in 2016.  440,000 led to death, and 70% of those deaths were children.  While these numbers are lower than previous years, 
       as you can see, they are   slowly on the rise again.
       Because of this, the natives to Africa have developed ways to fight it 
       through both biology, and through geography.  
       However, sometimes, even when doing all they can, people still get the disease, and a lot of the time die.  So how does this happen?  
      How is the spread of Malaria affected by Africa’s climate, proximity to water, and how have the natives to Africa evolved to fight it?</p>

    	<h3>Climate in Africa, and its effect on the spread of Malaria</h3>
      <p>The climate in Africa is easily one of the harshest, most diverse continents on the Earth.  The northern section of Africa is composed of an
      arid desert.  This differs greatly from the central and southern portion of Africa, which is primarily a wet rainforest.  Along with all of this,
      Africa is actually the hottest continent on the planet.  
      Now, it's well known that Malaria is spread through mosquitoes.  Unfortunately mosquitos thrive within hot, humid water.  Central
      and Southern Africa, or Sub-Saharan Africa, have the most mosquitos, and thus Malaria cases due to its hot, humid weather.  So naturally, the spread of 
      Malaria is substantially increased thanks to the natural climate that occurs in Africa.  
      However, that isn't all of it.  The hotter it is, the more energy your body will burn to stay cool.  The less energy you have, the harder it is
      for your body to fight off invaders.  All in all, the climate in Africa is easily one of the things that exacerbates the spread of Malaria.</p>

    	<h3>A Location's Proximity to Water, and its effect on the spread of Malaria</h3>
    	<p>Water has a large impact on the spread of disease.  When it comes to Malaria, water creates big problems.  Mosquitoes bread incredibly easily in 
      still water, but they have a hard time in running water.  The more Mosquitoes there are in a given area, the more likely a Malaria outbreak
      is to occur.
